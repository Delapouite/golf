Kakoune vimgolf challenges
==========================

Here are some vimgolf challenges along with their Kakoune solutions.

Theses benchmark serves as regressions tests and as a comparison against vim.

Each challenge directory contains a in, out and cmd file. in and out files
are directly copied from vimgolf websites, the cmd file contains the keys
used to solve the challenge.

For ease of comparison, we use a special mapping ',q' for :wq<ret>, which mimics
the vim ZZ binding.
