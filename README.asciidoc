Kakoune vimgolf challenges
==========================

Here are some vimgolf challenges along with their Kakoune solutions.

Theses benchmark serves as regressions tests and as a comparison against vim.

Each challenge directory contains a in, out and cmd file. in and out files
are directly copied from vimgolf websites, the cmd file contains the keys
used to solve the challenge.

Keep in mind that Kakoune does not support ZZ, only :wq<ret> so challeges
scores could easily be made 2 keys less.
